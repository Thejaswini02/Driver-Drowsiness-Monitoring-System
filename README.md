# Driver-Drowsiness-Monitoring-System



*** Components Required  ***

Python Libraries: OpenCV, Dlib, Scipy, Flask

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the web interface



Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Step 2: Drowsiness Detection in Python

Step 3: HTML for Front-End

Step 4: Running the System

a. Place the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file in the same directory as your Python script. You can download this file from dlib's model zoo.

b. Run the Flask application:

python drowsiness_detection.py

c. Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the video feed with drowsiness detection.
This setup creates a basic driver drowsiness monitoring system. You can enhance it further by adding more sophisticated algorithms and features like sending alerts, logging drowsiness events, and integrating with a vehicle's system.
